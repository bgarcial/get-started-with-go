/*
There is a way to declare a variable without explicitly stating 
its type using the short declaration := operator. 
We might use the := operator if we know what value we want our 
variable to store when creating it. For instance:
nuclearMeltdownOccurring := true
radiumInGroundWater := 4.521
daysSinceLastWorkplaceCatastrophe := 0
externalMessage := "Everything is normal. Keep calm and carry on."


Go also offers a separate syntax to declare a variable and infer its type. 
We couldâ€™ve written the same code from above as:

var nuclearMeltdownOccurring = true
var radiumInGroundWater = 4.521
var daysSinceLastWorkplaceCatastrophe = 0
var externalMessage = "Everything is normal. Keep calm and carry on."
