	First, we print How are you doing? to the terminal. Then we declare a variable, 
	response with the type string. fmt.Scan(&response) takes the first value before 
	a space and stores it in response. In the terminal, we would see:

	How are you doing?

	If we type good

	How are you doing?
	good
	I'm good.
	*/

	/*
	However, if we tried to type in not bad:
	How are you doing?
	not bad
	I'm not.

	Only the not part is saved, since it was separated from bad by a space. 
	If we were expecting two values, weâ€™d need to declare two variables ahead of time:
	
	fmt.Scan() expects addresses for arguments, hence the & before response1 and response2.
